# Building a VST Plugin using GCC

This guide will walk you through the process of building a VST plugin using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection). The specific command provided below is an example and may need to be adjusted based on your project's directory structure and file names.

## Prerequisites

Before building your VST plugin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- JUCE library and its dependencies
- Additional dependencies required by JUCE (e.g., ALSA, JACK) if applicable

Ensure that you have the correct versions of these dependencies installed on your system. Refer to the JUCE documentation for detailed information on installing and setting up JUCE.

## Building the VST Plugin

To build your VST plugin using GCC, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project directory.

3. Run the following command:

g++ -shared -fPIC -I/path/to/juce/modules -o myplugin.dll main.cpp HarmonicsPluginProcessor.cpp HarmonicsPluginEditor.cpp -L/path/to/juce/bin -ljuce-audio-basics -ljuce-audio-devices -ljuce-audio-formats -ljuce-audio-processors -ljuce-audio-utils -ljuce-core -ljuce-data-structures -ljuce-events -ljuce-graphics -ljuce-gui-basics -ljuce-gui-extra

vbnet
Copy code

Make sure to replace `/path/to/juce/modules` with the actual path to the JUCE library's modules directory and `/path/to/juce/bin` with the path to the JUCE library's binary directory.

This command instructs the GCC compiler to:

- Generate a shared object (`-shared`).
- Create position-independent code (`-fPIC`).
- Include the JUCE library's headers (`-I/path/to/juce/modules`).
- Output the compiled plugin to a file named `myplugin.dll` (`-o myplugin.dll`).
- Include the necessary source files for the processor and editor classes.
- Link against the JUCE library's binary files and specific modules required by your plugin.

Adjust the source file names and paths according to your project's structure.

4. GCC will compile and link your plugin. If there are no errors, the VST plugin file (`myplugin.dll`) will be created in your project directory.

## Acknowledgments

- The building process described in this guide uses GCC, a widely used compiler collection.
- The JUCE library provides a framework for developing audio applications, including VST plugins. Make sure to consult the JUCE documentation for more information on setting up your project.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to contact me.

Please note that this README assumes a Windows environment due to the use of .dll as the plugin file extension. If you're working on a different operating system, you may need to adjust the file extension accordingly (e.g., .so for Linux).

The specific command to build a VST plugin using GCC would depend on the specific directory structure and file names of your project. Here is an example command that shows how you might build a plugin using GCC:

g++ -shared -fPIC -I/path/to/juce/modules -o myplugin.dll main.cpp HarmonicsPluginProcessor.cpp HarmonicsPluginEditor.cpp -L/path/to/juce/bin -ljuce-audio-basics -ljuce-audio-devices -ljuce-audio-formats -ljuce-audio-processors -ljuce-audio-utils -ljuce-core -ljuce-data-structures -ljuce-events -ljuce-graphics -ljuce-gui-basics -ljuce-gui-extra

This command tells the GCC compiler to:

generate a shared object (-shared)
create position-independent code (-fPIC)
include the JUCE library's headers (-I/path/to/juce/modules)
output the compiled plugin to a file named myplugin.dll (-o myplugin.dll)
include the source files for the processor and editor classes (main.cpp, HarmonicsPluginProcessor.cpp, HarmonicsPluginEditor.cpp)
link against the JUCE library's binary files (-L/path/to/juce/bin)
link against the specific JUCE modules required by your plugin (-ljuce-audio-basics, -ljuce-audio-devices, etc.)
You will need to adjust the paths and file names to match your specific project.

Also, you may have to install additional dependencies that JUCE need to be compiled like ALSA or jack, please check the JUCE website for more information about this topic.
